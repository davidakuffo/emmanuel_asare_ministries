              God is the creator and ruler of the universe. He has eternally
              existed in three persons - the Father, the Son, and the Holy
              Spirit. These three are co-equal and are one God.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Man is made in the spiritual image of God, to be like him in
              character. He is the supreme object of God's creation. Although
              man has tremendous potential for good, he is marred by an attitude
              of disobedience toward God called "sin." This attitude separates
              man from God.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Man was created to exist forever. He will either exist eternally
              separated from God by sin or in union with God through forgiveness
              and salvation. To be eternally separated from God is hell. To be
              eternally in union with him is eternal life. Heaven and hell are
              places of eternal existence.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is co-equal with the Father.
              Jesus lived a sinless human life and offered himself as the
              perfect sacrifice for the sins of all men by dying on a cross. He
              arose from the dead after three days to demonstrate His power over
              sin and death. He ascended to heaven's glory and will return again
              to earth to reign as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">About Salvation</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Salvation is a gift from God to man. Man can never make up for his
              sin by self-improvement or good works - only by trusting in Jesus
              Christ as God's offer of forgiveness can man be saved from sin's
              penalty. Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ
              into his life by faith.

              Because it is inspired by God, it is truth without any mixture of
